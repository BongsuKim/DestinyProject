<h2>What is Combat Rating</h2>
<p>Before we dive into the details, we need to establish what Combat Rating is and what it's purpose is.
Combat Rating is a metric that Bungie tags to each player.
In this context, combat ratings are given out at the end of each <em>game</em>.
This analysis is not trying to predict your combat rating over life.  It is a game by game prediction.
However, assuming the Bungie does aggregate combat rating in some form over time, then our overall combat rating is a direct result of our game by game combat ratings.</p>
<p>Let's look at the distribution of combat rating in order to better understand it's function.
For those of you who have been following Stat Porn Sundays in the past, this plot will look familiar.</p>
<div class = 'plotContainer'><h4 class='text-center'><a href = '../pages/fullPlots/combatRating/combatRatingDist.html'>Combat Rating Distribution Curve</a></h4><div class ='plot' id='combatRatingDist''><svg></svg><script src='../pages/fullPlots/combatRating/javascripts/combatRatingDist.js''></script></div></div><p>As we can see fom that graph, the distribution of combat ratings looks pretty normally distributed, which is what we would expect from a metric like this.
Bungie needs a way to compare player skill level.
The entire basis of a fair and balanced matchmaking system rests on the idea that there is a way to create teams such that each team has an equal chance at success.
By creating a metric that falls in line with the normal distribution, we can clearly see who the bad, the average and the good players are.
But these titles of &quot;bad&quot;, &quot;average&quot; and &quot;good&quot; are all subjective.</p>
<p>What this analysis is going to try and do is <strong>examine how Bungie determines player skill</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="s-and-0s">
<h2>-1s and 0s</h2>
<p>I did remove all players who had a combat rating of -1 or 0 when making that distribution graph.  This removes 4.4% of the total population but still leaves us with over 100,000 entries. These anomlous cases are interesting because they can tell us a few things about Combat Rating.</p>
<p>First, take the instances where combat rating is 0.
I took this subset of data and then went and tried to find the columns that had a constant value.
I found 3 columns in which this was the case: <em>score</em>, <em>averageScorePerLife</em>, and <em>averageScorePerKill</em>.
Basically, if your score is 0, you're combat rating is 0 which is not suprising.  A score of 0 means the player didn't do anything during the game.</p>
<p>But that's where this gets interesting.
Of all of the players who had a combat rating of 0, <em>4%</em> of them had at least 1 kill, <em>2.5%</em> had at least 1 assist, and <em>3.4%</em> of them had at least one zone capture.
All of these actions should have resulted in the player being awarded points and having some form of score.
However, it didn't and as a result they received a combat rating of 0.</p>
<p>This gives us two possibilities.  Option 1 is that combat rating is a <em>multiple</em> of score.  In other words, the equation looks like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">combat_rating</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">score</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">other_calculated_values</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Where <em>other_calculated_values</em> is the output of some other function that takes into account game information to give you a score.
This would satisfy the condition that all players who receive a combat rating of 0 also have a score of 0.</p>
<p>The other possibility is that Combat Rating is actually not a strict mathematical equation but rather a block of code of the form:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">score</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="c">#{other logic preprocessing}#</span>
<span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="c">#do math</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">combatRating</span>
</pre></div>
<p>It would make sense that Bungie does some pre-processing of the data before trying to calculate scores.
Since data can be lost and/or corrupted for a number of reasons, they would want to check the data before they process it or else face the wrath of angry computer messages telling you that you are a stupid and worthless human.
However, we have no way of knowing which one it is.  The pressence of other constant values would help to support the preprocessing theory.
Those constants stand in as flags and the preprocessing code-block checks for those flags and then makes a desicion, but the score variables are the only constants in this subset.</p>
<p>Fortunately, looking at the -1 case helps us out a bit.  These are a very, very smaller number of cases (76 total) but 19 columns had a constant value.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Many of these columns are infered off of others, so it really boils down to:</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>kills</li>
<li>deaths</li>
<li>assists</li>
<li>objectivesCompleted</li>
<li>zonesNeutralized</li>
<li>score</li>
<li>standing</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Some interesting factoids here are that the standing value marks whether the player won or loss, with a 0 being a win and a 1 being a loss.
All of these players were marked with a 0 for standing.  In other words all were attributed with a win, but were still given a combat rating of 0.
Noticeably missing from this list is <em>completed</em> which marks whether or not a player completed the match (0 being yes, 1 being no).
So quitting does not give you a combat rating of -1 nor does it gaurantee you a combat rating of 0.</p>
<p>This leads me to believe that combat rating is being calculated in some sort of logic block.  Something goes awry, and Bungie's system picks up on it and gives all of these players a -1 value.  So the block looks something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">score</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">kills</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="c">#{other preprocessing}#</span>
<span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="c">#do math</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">combatRating</span>
</pre></div>
<p>However, I ended up throwing out the all players with a combat rating less than <em>or equal to</em> 0.
The reason is that we know already know what causes them to be 0.
I don't want this group of players artificially decreasing or inflating the prediciton scores.</p>
<p>Moving forward, when I refer to <em>the dataset</em> I am talking about <strong>all players in my dataset who had a combat rating greater than 0.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="first-predictions">
<h2>First Predictions</h2>
<p>In order to do the first prediction, I tried to minimize the number of columns that I was looking at.
I narrowed it down to only columns with numerical data and tried to avoid columns that were subsets of other columns.
For example, I have a series of columns that are titled <em>weaponKills[WeaponType]</em> where <em>[WeaponType]</em> is something like <em>PulseRifle</em> or <em>Sniper</em>.
After all this, there were still 23 columns that I could use.</p>
<p>In order to predict combat rating, I am using a lot of modules from <a class="reference external" href="http://scikit-learn.org/">scikit</a>.</p>
<p>Scikit comes with a bunch of modules designed to do regression and pre-processsing of data.
I used <a class="reference external" href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.SelectPercentile.html">SelectPercentile</a> with a <a class="reference external" href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.f_regression.html#sklearn.feature_selection.f_regression">univariate linear regression test</a> to try and find which columns make for the best predictors.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>I started with only the predictors that scored in the top 10% (i.e. the top 3 predictors) which were:</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>score</li>
<li>kills</li>
<li>longestKillSpree</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I then ran a <a class="reference external" href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Ridge.html">ridge regression</a> to predict combat rating.
I sliced the dataset in 10 different ways, each time using 80% of the dataset for training, and 20% for testing and ran the ridge regression across each training/test pair.
Finally, I calculated several different scoring metrics and took the average of these across all of the runs.</p>
<p>What I finally ended up with was a <strong>variance score of 0.8668675</strong> and a <strong>r-sqaured score of 0.8459838</strong>.
For both of those scores, a value of 1 indicates a perfect match.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>So, my first test using only 3 predictors had an accuracy of 85% with the following coeffecients</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li><em>kills</em>: -0.929154918057</li>
<li><em>longestKillSpree</em>: 3.40214824993</li>
<li><em>score</em>: 0.0311323984706</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Giving us the grand equation:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">combat_rating</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">0.929154918057</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">kills</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">3.40214824993</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">longestKillSpree</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">0.0311323984706</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">score</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</blockquote>
<p>It's interesting to note that <em>kills</em> has a negative coefficient.  That means that the more kills someone has, the <em>lower</em> their combat rating.
Logically, it makes very little sense.  Why punish people who have a higher number of kills?
1 kill is almost 1 less combat rating point.  But since (on average) players get <strong>12 kills</strong> in a given match, that means that this isn't dropping their combat rating by a lot.</p>
<p>This decrease is also made up by the <em>longestKillSpree</em> variable.  The average player has a <em>longestKillSpree</em> value of 3.7.
Let's knock it down to 3 since you can't have .7 of a kill.  Let's plug the average player into this equation and see what we get.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">combat_rating</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">0.929154918057</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">12</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">3.40214824993</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">0.0311323984706</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">score</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">combat_rating</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">0.9434142668940009</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">0.0311323984706</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">score</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>So the average player really only sees a knock down of less than a point to their combat rating under this model.
If we think about this setup a little bit more, it actually makes a lot of sense.
A player who runs around and gets a ton of kills but only gets 1 kill per life is maybe not as &quot;good&quot; as a player who has a lower number of kills, but never dies.</p>
<p>Let's take two test cases.  The standard deviation on <em>kills</em> is about 7, so let's go one standard deviation in either direction.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">high_kills_cr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">0.929154918057</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">19</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">3.40214824993</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">0.0311323984706</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">score</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">high_kills_cr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">14.251795193153</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">0.0311323984706</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">score</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">low_kills_cr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">0.929154918057</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">5</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">3.40214824993</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">0.0311323984706</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">score</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">low_kills_cr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">12.364966659364999</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">0.0311323984706</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">score</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This extreme case helps illustrate the point that combat rating seems to favor you're ability to get a spree going.
The player who runs around and gets a lot of kills, but can't stay alive for more than 1 kill is going to be penalized.  But this does not mean that the player with the 5 kill streak <em>did not die</em>.  They could have died 15 times, but had one good streak.</p>
<p>But the real dominating factor is your score.  Score get's hit with a tiny coefficient, but score has the fastest growth.
Kills and longestKillSpree only increase in increments of 1, whereas score is increasing in a variety of increments, all of which are greater than 25.
Our cautious player with only 5 kills, but a 5 kill-streak, is not going to have as many points as our blood-lusting player with 19 kills with a longestKillSpree of 1.</p>
<p>So let's calculate this all the way to the end using some real player data.  I hand-picked these two players to compare.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">high_kills_cr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">0.929154918057</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">3.40214824993</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">0.0311323984706</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">4140</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">high_kills_cr</span> <span class="o">=</span>  <span class="mf">117.109327807004</span>
<span class="n">low_kills_cr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">0.929154918057</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">3.40214824993</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">0.0311323984706</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">1455</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">low_kills_cr</span> <span class="o">=</span>  <span class="mf">55.804296597973995</span>
</pre></div>
<p>So while the <em>low_kills</em> player may have had a greater boost from their longestKillSpree, their combat rating is still significantly lower because they do not have as high of a score.</p>
<p>In general, what this means is that score is the predominate factor in deciding your combat rating, but what differentiates players who a near equal score is the combination of their kills and their longestKillSpree.</p>

<div class="section" id="predictions-round-2">
<h2>Predictions Round 2</h2>
<p>Noticeably absent from this conversation is any mention of objectives.
The first round of predictions used only 3 variables all of which were related to a player's ability to kill oponents.
Score takes into account everything you do though, which is part of the reason why it's probably one of the best predictors.</p>
<p>For the second round of predictions, I used <em>all</em> 24 columns.

<dt>A few notes about this:</dt>
<dd><ol class="first last arabic simple">
<li><em>standing</em> is 0 if the player <strong>won</strong> the game, 1 if they lost it.  That's why standing has a negative coefficient.  Player's are penalized for losing.</li>
<li><em>place</em> is a value that I calculated.  It is the player's place on the leaderboard at the end of the game.  1 is for the best player, and continues increasing from there.  It is essentially another way of looking at score.  But it has a negative coefficient because as a player falls down the leaderboard, they lose combat rating.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>But some of these values make <strong>no sense</strong> whatsoever.  Why would player's be penalized for getting precisionKills?  If you look carefully, you will also see that <em>longestKillSpree</em> now has a negative coefficient so player's are being penalized for having large sprees.  And why are all of the objective related coefficients negative? While this gave us a high accuracy, the equation itself makes no (intuitive) logical sense which then makes it difficult to further analyze.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bungie-s-definition-of-combat-rating">
<h2>Bungie's Definition of Combat Rating</h2>
<p>When I originally set out to do this post, I thought I was going to be defining what Combat Rating is, but Bungie actually has public defined Combat Rating as:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;An assessment of your skill and teamwork.  It factors in your score compared to others in each match and penalizes you for quitting.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>That gives us something more to work with.
Looking at the last table in light of this definition, you see that a lot of those coefficients don't make sense.
For example, <em>completed</em> has a positive coefficient.
The model we currently have adds 22 times <em>completed</em> to the equation.
This means that player's are <em>rewarded</em> for completing a match because a 1 means the player successfully completed the match.
However, Bungie's definition clearly says that players are <em>penalized</em> for not completing a match.
So, what we need to do is actually flip the representation of <em>completed</em> around so that 1 is quit, and 0 is completed.
This causes the trending algorithm to give <em>completed</em> a negative coefficient.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>This creates a way for us to describe the different variables:</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li><strong>reward variables</strong>:   variables that have a <em>positive</em> cofficient.  The <em>greater</em> the value, the <em>higher</em> your combat rating should be.</li>
<li><strong>penalty variables</strong>:  variables that have a <em>negative</em> coefficient.  The <em>greater</em> the value, the <em>lower</em> your combat rating should be.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>We have to define all of our variables in light of this framework, especially variables that are boolean or discrete in nature.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>The variables that are most affected by this are:</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li><strong>standing</strong>: 0 is victory, 1 is loss, but I think it makes more sense to reward people for winning than penalizing them for losing.  So standing is flipped before the trending algorithm runs.</li>
<li><strong>place</strong>:  this variable ranks you against everyone else in the match.  1 means you were the highest scoring player, and it continuous to decrease.  But, this creates a <em>penalty</em> variable where lower ranked players are penalized more for doing worse.  To recity this I created a new variable named <em>rank</em> which is: 1.0-(place/number_of_players_in_game).  This creates a value between 0 and 1.  The closer you are to 1, the greater your score was relative to everyone else.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>After applying these changes, the accuracy of the prediciton did not change, and the coefficients made no more sense than they had initially.
I felt like I had hit a pretty serious road block at this point because not only did the model create an equation that made no sense with amazing accuracy, it also didn't stay true to Bungie's definition of combat rating.
I decided to step away from doing actual predicitons to instead look at what the <em>goal</em> of Combat Rating is.
And in order to do that, I took a trip down memory lane and went back to TrueSkill.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="microsoft-s-trueskill">
<h2>Microsoft's TrueSkill</h2>
<p>TrueSkill is Microsoft's algorithm for ranking player's in online matchmaking.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>There are a lot of good resources for understanding TrueSkill:</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://trueskill.org/">http://trueskill.org/</a> :   a Python implementation of the TrueSkill ranking system</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=67956">TrueSkill(TM): A Bayesian Skill Rating System</a>: Microsoft's published account of how TrueSkill works.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/trueskill/default.aspx">TrueSkill(TM) Homepage</a>: The TrueSKill homepage with links to all of Microsoft's TrueSkill publications along with detailed explanations for how TrueSkill works.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.moserware.com/2010/03/computing-your-skill.html">Computing Your Skill</a>: a <em>very</em> well done explanation for the stats behind TrueSkill and the other ranking systems that it is based on.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Each of those links will take you on a long winded tangent about how TrueSkill and other ranking systems function.
But the essence of TrueSkill is that it predicts your chances of winning based on your TrueSkill level relative to everyone else,
then it modifies player's TrueSkill levels based on whether they beat the odds or not.
A player who is predicted to lose but wins will have a greater increase in their TrueSkill level than someone who is predicted to win and wins.
TrueSkill was also designed to lock players into a skill level quickly.
The Microsoft report uses numbers from Halo 2 to show that TrueSkill can lock in on a player's skill level in approximately <em>10 games</em> for 4 vs 4 gamemodes.
Note however, that a player is only evaluated based on whether they won or lost the game.</p>
<p>This fast convergence actually became a problem in Halo 3 where we saw the birth of the infamous <em>Second Accounters</em>.
These were players who felt like TrueSkill had unfairly locked them into a certain rank and that they could actually acheive higher.
So, they created entirely new accounts.
These new accounts were set at an average level, and since these were usually players who had been playing for a while their actual skill level was much higher.
The trick to a second account was to have high ranked friends who would then go into matchmaking with you.
TrueSkill would say that the new second accounter had a very low chance of success, and when they would win, their skill level would be jump drastically allowing them to reach the highest level possible (50) in a short amount of time.</p>
<p>TrueSkill's purpose is to rank players in order to preform better matchmaking.
Matchmaking under TrueSkill is done by trying to find players that you are most likely to <em>tie</em> with.
That is, the odds for winning or losing are as close to 50% as possible.</p>
<p>This makes sense in a 1v1 context, but not so much sense in a team setting.  There are very few players in the low buckets and even fewer in the high buckets, so how do you let these player's find matches?  Ideally, you would only pair high level players with other high level players, but there may not be enough high level players to support that.  This would result in slow matchmaking for higher tier players and they would probably being playing with the same group of players over and over again.</p>
<p>The natural inclination is to say that teams are nothing more than the sum of their parts.
Team matchmaking is then about finding two groups where the <em>average</em> combat rating for each team is relatively close.</p>

What we see here is that the mean is almost right on the 50% mark which is a strong indication that the curve is normally distributed.
70.23% of values lie within 1 standard deviation of the mean.
With a perfectly normally distributed curve, that value should be 68%, so we are very close here.
The reason that finding a normally distributed curve is so important is that it is what TrueSkill had other skill ranking systems use, so it allows us to compare Combat Rating to these other skill ranking systems.
It also strongly indicates to us Combat Rating is a part of the system that Bungie is using to rank players <strong>and</strong> to establish fair matchmaking.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="matchmaking">
<h2>Matchmaking</h2>
<p>The claim I made can further be backed up by looking at the <em>difference</em> in Combat Rating between teams.</p>
<div class = 'plotContainer'><h4 class='text-center'><a href = '../pages/fullPlots/combatRating/combatRatingDiff.html'>Distribution of Difference in Combat Rating between Teams</a></h4><div class ='plot' id='combatRatingDiff''><svg></svg><script src='../pages/fullPlots/combatRating/javascripts/combatRatingDiff.js''></script></div></div><p>It is important to understand that the Combat Rating for each team is the <em>average</em> of all the players on the team.
Also, the Combat Rating values I am using are caluclated <em>postgame</em>.
It is not the difference going into the game, but the difference at the end of the game.</p>
<p>So what that graph really shows us is how well Bungie's matchmaking creates &quot;fair&quot; matches.
51% of matches end with the two teams being within 2 standard deviations of eachother.
That's not too bad.  What is bad is that means that 49% of matches are outside of 2 standard deviations.
In other words, 49% of matches are pretty definitive with one team clearly being the winner over the other.</p>
<div class = 'plotContainer'><h4 class='text-center'><a href = '../pages/fullPlots/combatRating/scoreDiff.html'>Distribution of Difference in Score between Teams</a></h4><div class ='plot' id='scoreDiff''><svg></svg><script src='../pages/fullPlots/combatRating/javascripts/scoreDiff.js''></script></div></div><p>The other way to see this &quot;fairness&quot; in play is to look at the difference in score at the end of a match.
The shape of this curve is <em>very</em> similar to the difference in Combat Rating between teams.
The score graph gives us some more perspective.
39% of games end with the two teams being within 4461 points from one another.
I would say that this reprents our fair group.  However, that means that 61% of games end with a point difference greter than 4461.
About 10% of games end with a team winning by over 11,000.</p>
<p>The point of this is to show that score and Combat Rating are closely related (as Bungie's definition stated).
It also shows us that the current matchmaking system is not necessarily ideal.
There are <em>likely</em> many factors that go into determing what makes a &quot;good&quot; match.
Such factors could be network connectivity, fireteam size, and combat rating.</p>

<h2>Predictions Round 2</h2>
<p>I've spent a considerable amount of text here convincing you that Bungie's definition of Combat Rating lines up with it's implementation.
However, using score with all of the other variables completely throws off the prediciton. While we get a <em>very</em> good prediciton, the equation doesn't make any sense.
That's because, score is already a linear calculation of how the player performed in a given game.
Assists are worth half that of kills, so player's are rewarded for assists, but are rewarded even more for kills.</p>
<p>Makes sense.</p>
<p>When we remvoe score from the prediction and try to use all of the components that make up score we get an <strong>R-Squared value of 0.883</strong> and a <strong>Variance score of 0.894</strong>.
Not as high as when we included score and a host of other variables, but it is still a strong score, and all of our coefficients make sense.</p>
