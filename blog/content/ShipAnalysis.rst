Here we are again
-------------------
Welcome to the *sixth* installment in this wonderful series where we take a few moments to think about the things that no one else has the time (or energy) to think about.

Last week we talked about `faction distribution <https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/3gdai9/stat_porn_sunday_i_pledge_allegiance/>`_.
Today we are going to continue look at character data and examine **ship distribution**.

Fly Away
----------
Ships have 0 functionality in the game.
They are really nothing more than a loading screen, but there are some interesting dynamics when we look at how player's chose their ships.

This post is going to be a bit different from other's since I'm not going to immediately throw out all players below level 20 and say that they don't matter.
Player's of all levels can equip a ship as long as they have completed the story mission where you get your first one.
Ships are also one of the only ways to show off your acheivements to the community.
Class items serve the a similar role, but they compete with Faction items and have a greater impact on the overall look of a character.
Ships are also a way to assert some sort of difference from the rest of the community.
As we've seen, most people `equip the same shaders <https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/3eol7l/stat_porn_sunday_i_am_the_prettiest_guardian/>`_, but there are a lot more ships out there to chose from.

But maybe then again, ships could potentially follow the same trend as shaders, with players opting to pick the "coolest" looking ships.

.. plot:: MostUsedShipsOverall Top 10 Ships Overall
    :dir: ../pages/fullPlots/characterData/

Ship choices have a greater amount of variation than shaders.  With ships the top 10 only account for about 46% percent of all use versus shaders, where the top 10 accounted for about 65% of all use.
But this isn't necessarily a fair analysis because many players can't equip ship other than the *Arcadia Class Jumpship* because it's the first one you get and they may not have others.

.. plot:: MostUsedShipsAboveLevel20 Top 10 Ships For Players Above Level 20
    :dir: ../pages/fullPlots/characterData/

When we just look at the players who are level 20 and above, we see that the top 10 ships account for about 50% of all use.
Still more variation than shaders, but this still indicates that there are a lot of people out there who are all flying the same model.
What's also interesting about this graph is that many of the top 10 ships are rewards for raids, or require a significant amount of work to obtain.
The Hildian Seeker is not the most challenging ship to obtain, but you do have to go out of your way to get it.
It's not like it's a random Crucible drop or something.
This indicates that players prefer to use ships as means to boast their accomplishments rather than using them as a tool to stand out.
You'd think the two would be the same thing - that these accomplishments would make one stand out - but in reality it's not the case.

If players really wanted to stand out these would be the ships that they would use.

.. plot:: LeastUsedShipsAboveLevel20 10 Least Used Ships for Players Above Level 20
    :dir: ../pages/fullPlots/characterData

None of these ships are legendary tier.
So it seems like players will either choose a ship that shows off some sort of accomplishment (generally legendary tier) or a legendary tier ship.
All of those ships in the top *least* used are purchasable through the Shipwright.
So it's not like they are impossible to obtain.
I find it interesting that people (myself included) don't even consider these Common ships and instead settle for the Legendary tier ships.
Legendary is somehow cooler than common even though some of the Common and Uncommon ships look cool too.
The only difference is that the Legendary tier ships have a purple background and a slogan attached.

.. plot:: shipTierByLevel Ship Tier Frequency by Level
    :dir: ../pages/fullPlots/characterData

This graph shows what percent of people use what tier of ship in at a given level.  For instance, 87.83% of level 2 players use a Common ship.
Most players don't even bother with a Rare or Uncommon ships, and by the time you hit level 34, 91% of players are using some form of Legendary ship.

These plots also exist for players below level 20.  I don't find them too interesting, but they are here if you want to check them out:

    - `10 Least Used Ships for Players Below Level 20 </DestinyProject/blog/output/pages/fullPlots/characterData/LeastUsedShipsBelowLevel20.html>`_

TL;DR
---------------
Generally, Common ships are the most used probably because they don't require a whole lot of effort to obtain early on.
However, players immediately switch over to a Legendary ship as soon as they have the opportunity, bypassing all the ships that lie inbetween.
